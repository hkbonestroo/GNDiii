               <h4>Delta as a place of wealth</h4>
                <p>
                  Water is life in the Mississippi Delta, and sometimes also death. Constrained by levees the height of a 5-story building that both protect and threaten those on the other side, the Mississippi River drains water from about 41% of the United States, carrying with it the nutrients, barges and flotsam of faraway cities and fields. The flow of the river guides the gaze, making it natural to orient downriver, to assume the delta is defined by what it receives. The fertile land along the riverbanks and lush maze of the bayous echoes a similar story. But the delta has never been merely – or mainly – a terminus, it is more often a point of departure, a tap, a mine, a meandering corridor oriented towards many elsewhere. The wealth is embedded in the layers of topsoil, sediment and fossilized organic material trapped 2,000+ feet underneath the current river’s edge. This wealth also lives within the bodies and cultures of those who work and know the land; have surveyed, measured, and priced it, and themselves have been surveyed, measured, and priced. Their value to Delta’s farmland has been immeasurable, yet the region’s slaveholding planters and contemporary corporate landowners have held a monopoly control over the fruits of this labor and knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <h5>  
The worship and extraction of <b>land, labor and resources</b> in the Delta, even as their value is marginalized and cheapened, is one of the region’s many paradoxes; one that produces and re-produces violence and dispossession across the landscape at multiple scales.  
</h5>

<p>A corollary paradox is the role of technology in this land of many literal and figurative ‘backwaters’ – technology has always been integral for processes of extraction, beginning with enslaved people being treated as instruments to transform the rich soil of the Delta into financial riches for the class of planters who owned nearly all of the land and many of its people.

                          <p>Further south, the North Gulf of Mexico a direct result of the Mississippi River Delta, and that point of convergence between the salt and fresh waters. Along the Mississippi River, the relation to water and empire are explicit in the town names that recall its North African cousin: Cairo, Illinois; Luxora, Arkansas; Thebes, Illinois; Egypt, Tennessee. They are/were places of plenty, buoyed by the meanders and floods of a river coursing through what became – through settler colonialism – the middle of the United States.

                           <p>The letter Δ is also used in mathematics to denote change, a concept that resonates in a riverine landscape where water shapes land, labor, and resources, and is itself shaped by the land, labor, and resources of the cultures that bind a river and its community. Petroleum, people, cotton, sugar, music, benzene and plastic have made their exodus via the river in a constant stream, carving out channels to new markets, new buyers, new visions of profit, remaking the Mississippi and its people over and over again. You can never step in the same river twice.

               <p>Three powerful forces of extraction  are particularly evident in the Delta: 
                  <li>the extraction of land</li> 
                  <li>the extraction of people or labor</li>

               <p>These  extractive forces have not been perpetrated uncontested: significant resistance, opposition, and resilience towards each type of extraction has been fostered in the region, and we will be highlighting examples of these to show the fertile ground for change.

                           <p>Winning a Green New Deal for the Delta will have to fundamentally transform the processes, relationships and structures that commodify the land, labor and resources of the Delta. Transformation is a process more than an outcome, and as such procedural justice (the ‘how’) will matter just as much if not more than substantive justice (the ‘what’), particularly because many of these processes don’t ever end, they continue evolving. In that spirit, there are three overarching goals in transforming this region:  
<ol type = "1">
                              <li>Reform and empower systems of <b>resource redistribution and governance</b> to link the local with the regional and national within a culture of respect, creativity and accountability.</li>
                              <li>Invest in processes of <b>care and regeneration</b> that center justice, healing and environmental regeneration that ends the cycle of extraction in the Delta.</li>
                              <li>Incentivize and resource<b> collective and collectivist ventures and organizing structures</b> within a framework that safeguards the right to self-determination and takes land, people, and resources out of commodity markets wherever possible.</li>
                           </ol>
                           </p>
                           <p>These goals are meant to honor and reflect the demands that grassroots and social movement groups in the Delta that have been imagining and building radical alternatives to the region’s extractive economy over decades and centuries.

                           <p>Winning a Green New Deal for the Delta will have to fundamentally transform the processes, relationships and structures that commodify the land, labor and resources of the Delta. Transformation is a process more than an outcome, and as such procedural justice (the ‘how’) will matter just as much if not more than substantive justice (the ‘what’), particularly because many of these processes don’t ever end, they continue evolving. In that spirit, there are three overarching goals in transforming this region:  
                           <ol type = "1">
                              <li>Reform and empower systems of <b>resource redistribution and governance</b> to link the local with the regional and national within a culture of respect, creativity and accountability.</li>
                              <li>Invest in processes of <b>care and regeneration</b> that center justice, healing and environmental regeneration that ends the cycle of extraction in the Delta.</li>
                              <li>Incentivize and resource<b> collective and collectivist ventures and organizing structures</b> within a framework that safeguards the right to self-determination and takes land, people, and resources out of commodity markets wherever possible.</li>
                           </ol>
                           </p>
                           <p>These goals are meant to honor and reflect the demands that <b>grassroots and social movement groups</b> in the Delta that have been imagining and building radical alternatives to the region’s extractive economy over decades and centuries. In this moment, we seek to follow the path set out by the coalition behind the <a href="https://f051d680-6bda-4883-b0d9-76edcc6ecdae.filesusr.com/ugd/6ac318_4a76df6a0cd949508798d3cbd66e3e62.pdf"> Gulf South for a Green New Deal</a>, <a href="https://m4bl.org/policy-platforms/reparations/"> Movement for Black Lives reparations platform </a>, the <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/true-new-deal-for-the-covid-19-era/"> Roosevelt Institute’s True New Deal</a>, <a href="https://f051d680-6bda-4883-b0d9-76edcc6ecdae.filesusr.com/ugd/6ac318_4a76df6a0cd949508798d3cbd66e3e62.pdf">NAACP’s Environmental and Climate Justice Program Goals</a>, <a href="https://psequity.org/just-energy/">Partnership for Southern Equity’s Just Energy equity ecosystem</a> and many others.   
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              These goals are intended to be abstract enough to guide action at <b>all scales</b>. In the spirit of Adrienne Marie Brown’s guide to emergent strategy, they should be viewed as almost fractal-like, producing similar structures and frameworks for interaction at the scale of a single site design or a Congressional budgeting session. This nested model allows for action at a variety of scales—a kind of intra- and inter-regional operability that’s necessary to build a just, democratic Green New Deal. A site design is not meaningful without the congressional budget appropriation that promises to make it a reality; nor is the closure of a federal prison facility as meaningful if it’s accompanied by an expanded state prison-building program. The national policy shifts called for in HR 109 and the <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/true-new-deal-for-the-covid-19-era/"> Roosevelt Institute’s True New Deal</a> are in many cases ideal preconditions for the Delta-specific program outlined below. This relationship is not linear or one-directional, however; a holistic approach to meeting these goals at the regional level will create a larger and more vocal constituency for national policy and funding changes, just as national funding, assistance and enforcement would help activate a local constituency to lead and support implementation efforts. Ultimately, our vision is one of agency—for the people of the Delta to wield the power and resources they need to build the kinds of futures they’ve been organizing around for generations.
                              </p>
                              <p> 
Using these three goals as framing devices, below we have traced out the potential shape of a new delta, leaning on all definitions of the word. A delta that embraces change, one that orients both upstream and downstream, one that leans into the strength of its triangular shape, imagining land, labor and resources as the three inseparable sides of a Green New Deal for the region.

                        <p>Prior to 1492, the indigenous nations of the Mississippi Delta were an integral part of trade routes spanning the continent and had class structures, communal land ownerships and large settlements similar to those of the more well-known Aztec and Maya. European colonizers enacted sequential waves of genocide that reduced the number of native people in the region five-fold from 1492 to 1692. What the Spanish and French started, Thomas Jefferson continued and Andrew Jackson finished through the Indian Removal Act of 1830 where ancestral Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek and Choctaw lands were violently appropriated for cotton, and surviving tribal members were forced to walk to lands in Oklahoma along the infamous and deadly Trail of Tears.

Through sheer force of will, Black landowners steadily increased their share of land in the beginning of the 20th century, but never attained ownership rates proportional with population composition. Social, political, economic, and legal obstacles persisted and by mid-century black landownership rates declined again in a period some refer to as the Great Dispossession. In fact, the combination of federal agricultural policy and corporate landowners resulted in land loss for small farmers of all races. In essence, “large plantations ballooned into even larger industrial crop factories as small farms collapsed.”

                           <p>Today, industrial agriculture continues to play a substantial role in the regional economy, as demonstrated by the percentage it comprises of each county’s GDP, up to 67% in some cases. The extraction of land that began with slave labor continues today to degrade the natural environment through an extensive deforestation, monoculture planting, GMO crops, and wide-spread pesticide use. Additionally, the loss of wetlands eliminated substantial carbon sinks.

                        <p>Addressing the first goal in the Green New Deal in the Delta will <b>reform and empower systems of resource redistribution and governance to link the local with the regional and national within a culture of respect, creativity and accountability</b>, by <u>reducing and ultimately ending subsidies for monocultures, especially non-food crops like corn and soybeans.</u> Corn and soybeans are the most widely planted crops in the United States and also are the most heavily subsidized crops by the federal government, costing taxpayers billions of dollars a year. Neither crop is a food source for US residents, since the majority of corn is used in ethanol production or refined products like high fructose corn syrup, while the majority of soybeans are exported outside the country.   
                        </p>
                        <p>Addressing the second goal in the Green New Deal for the Delta will <b>center processes of care and repair that hold justice, healing and environmental regeneration as key guiding principles. </b>Very real physical, economic and psychological harms have been wrought by the systems of extraction described above. White USDA farm insurance brokers pushed Black farm owners into bankruptcy; multinational petrochemical corporations took years of healthy living from residents of Cancer Alley; racist juries and sentencing guidelines put Black people behind bars for decades. The layers of dispossession and trauma call for a multi-decade investment in care and healing for the people and places who have endured the direct and indirect effects of this exploitation. It follows that healing requires 1) an end to ongoing processes that continue to cause harm and 2) reparative measures on terms set by those who have experienced harm.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>In the industrial agriculture sector, this looks like…</b>  
                        <li><u>restructuring the land inheritance system. </u> In order to reverse Black land loss and enable a more robust effort towards reparations, States must pass the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, which allows farmers and their heirs who lack clear title to their land to get title without risking that the property will be put up for auction. Clear titles to farmland enable the owners to access a range of USDA loan options, which have historically been withheld from Black farmers using unclear titles as an excuse.</li>
                        <li><u>environmental regeneration.</u> The levees surrounding the Mississippi River have created an environment that denies water its central role. Environmental degradation, stronger storms, and deteriorating infrastructure make this system untenable, but like the Green New Deal as a whole, there is an opportunity to address multiple problems with elegant solutions in the overly constrained riverine landscape. Encouraging the use of flood resistant crops like wetland agriculture (paludiculture), expanding the floodplain through buyouts and easements to make “room for the river,” and increasing the prevalence of aquaculture create sustainable ways to live with the water, rather than attempt to remove and control it. </li>
                        </p>
                        <p>Addressing the third goal in the Green New Deal for the Delta will <b>incentivize and resource collective and collectivist ventures and organizing structures within a framework that safeguards the right to self-determination.</b> Addressing climate change and dismantling extractive industries in the Delta will require collaboration and relationships. A legal, economic and social frame that lifts up individual needs at the expense of the collective no longer works.  Given that residents of the Delta have been organizing themselves and establishing systems of mutual aid for generations, it is clear that most people don’t want to go it alone when they have the option of operating in community with others. The public sector should recognize the need for collaborative and collectivist approaches and incentivize them where possible. 
                        </p>
                        <p>  <b>In the industrial agriculture sector, this looks like…</b>  
                        <li><u>collective ownership, both as a legal frame and a cultural frame.</u> In a twist of the “back to the land” campaign, we call for a “land back” movement where land is given back to the people as opposed to people returning to the land. Land taken from corporate landowners that have exploited and destroyed it for decades must be reallocated to farmworkers and governed in collective ownership. As a revival of the New Deal model of transforming former plantations to cooperatively-owned farms, corporate industrial farms will be transfigured into communal enterprises. Land ownership is power and land ownership provides freedom, so shifting control to those who have worked it will empower and transform the livelihoods of the masses in the Delta. </li>
                        <li><u>establishing a network of regenerative farms.</u> Transitioning from the current industrially-powered monocultural farming practices to more sustainable, regenerative methods will require and benefit from the formation of a network of farms in collective ownership. Environmental health, social equality, and economic stability are the cornerstones of this network of regenerative farms. Knowledge and best practices of farming in a way that maximizes benefits and minimizes destruction will be passed throughout the system to the mutual prosperity of its members. </li>

                        <p>The evolution of the carceral system within the Delta serves as a stark example of how exploitative practices reinvest themselves over time. The colonization of Native American land provided the necessary space to engineer a plantation-driven economy, culture, and rule of law. Generations later, this has created a carceral economy that has harmed the livelihood and prosperity of millions of households within the Delta. The region’s over-dependence on correctional related jobs, bloated police budgets, and perpetually high incarceration rates are key to understanding why a final transition from mass incarceration to restorative justice is necessary for the Delta.
                        </p>
                        <p>Following the abolition of slavery and immediate loss of labor, white powerbrokers conspired to establish the Convict Lease System: a deal in which wealthy landowners rented prisoners at extremely low wages to provide labor for their private development and farms. This program began in Louisiana in 1844 and remained a fixed feature of almost every southern economy and politic until the 1940’s.5 Despite widespread adoption, there was persistent condemnation ranging from literary observations like Mark Carlton’s <i>The Politics of the Convict Lease System in Louisiana </i>to grand jury reports in Mississippi which revealed disturbing details of hospitalized convicts whom were suffering starvation, disease, and brutality after working on farms and railroads. In fact, the report concluded that “God will never smile on a State that treats its convicts as Mississippi does.”

Ultimately, both states transitioned their largest plantations from Angola Farm and Parchman Farm, to the respective Louisiana and Mississippi State Penitentiary. The transition from enslaved to incarcerated people at the same facilities is emblematic of how white power structures reinvented systems of oppression through state legitimated programs.

                        <li><u>defunding and disbanding the police, and investing in communities.</u> State and local budgets are increasingly drained by expansive police budgets that increase nearly every year. Within the 17 largest metro areas in the Delta, police budgets command an average 24% of general operating budgets reaching as high as 43% in the city of Carbondale, Illinois and a total of $824 million across these jurisdictions. This issue becomes increasingly apparent when considering that each state in the Delta <u>spends a below average amount on education</u>, most <u>underinvest in health and hospital expenditures</u>, and have six of our eight states have minimum wages equivalent to the federal minimum of $7.25/hour. Grassroots organizations like the Orleans Parish Prison Coalition Reform have advocated against increasing expenditures within the New Orleans carceral system by <u>pressuring legislators to lower the personal jail cap</u>, halt the construction of a prison addition, and find a permanent solution to treating the city’s mentally ill population. While the ultimate vision is to engineer the complete closure of American prisons facilities, organizations like OPPC provide a model for communities across the Delta to take incremental steps towards reducing prison capacity, police budgets, and the ability for legislators to street greater capital into the carceral system.</li>

                       <li><u>decarceration</u>. The ultimate goal is to eliminate the need for the traditional prison system in America by providing the resources and opportunities necessary to live a prosperous life. In pursuit of the vision towards abolition, there are opportunities to remodel our carceral facilities into sites that are conducive to rehabilitation rather than purely sources of punishment.
                       <p>Citizens in New York City have already begun to envision the infrastructure necessary for a dramatic reduction in incarcerated persons through their advocacy for the closure of Rikers Island and the construction of smaller, more local prison facilities. In 2019, Mayor DeBlasio’s Office of Criminal Justice proposed that the “city jails population will fall to 3,3000 by 20206. Down from the more than 7,200 people incarcerated today.”6 Accompanying this reduction in the overall prison population would be the closure of Riker’s Island for the construction of new, local prisons in New York City. The closure of this infamous prison, improved location of inmates, and the opportunity to develop better facilities poses an attractive strategy to improve the conditions of prisoners in the short term. Sites like Angola and Parchman come to mind as potential examples where a similar strategy can be implemented. However, to achieve a reduction in the prison population, New York approved state-level bail reform, worked to increase the number of beds in hospitals for mental ill patients, and other measures to reduce the likelihood of individuals being introduced to the carceral system.

                           <li><u>moving from plantations to prisons to peace</u>. For the past couple centuries, fertile Delta land has been captured by private and state entities as a tool to extract wealth, labor, and livelihood of individuals in the region. As a result, systems of power in the Delta have rarely aligned with the vision and well-being of its residents, nor have they had the opportunity to design a landscape that would suit current and future needs. In imagining an idealized world where places like Parchman Farm and Angola Farm are no longer critical infrastructures for the carceral system it is difficult to envision what to replace these sites. Similar to the toxic soil that taint an ecosystem for generations, the legacy of labor exploitation presents a stubborn fissure in dire need of collective remediation. Prior to the physical design process taking place, components of a just transition will require reconciliation, affirmative apologies on behalf of the state and the many participants that have enabled these institutions to operate in an extrajudicial manner from their inception.</li>

                           <p>The Delta’s topography and geology – like deltas worldwide – make it not only a site of agricultural richness but of petroleum as well. The shallow shelf that protrudes from the mouth of the river into the ocean <u>allows rigs to access deeper reservoirs of oil</u> than they would otherwise, and the sediment deposited over millennia is associated with petroleum deposits. Tar and other hydrocarbons had been present in the landscape – used for sealing canoes and as insect repellent, but it wasn’t until 1911 that the first offshore rig in Louisiana was built in Caddo Lake, ten years after the gusher at Spindletop, Texas launched an oil boom in the region. In 1947 the first rig out of sight of land was installed in the Gulf of Mexico and the thousands of rigs that followed fed the United States’ growing energy demand after World War II. Refineries were built along the Gulf Coast beginning in 1909 to process not only the oil and gas from the region, but later also that transported in cross continental pipelines from oil fields thousands of miles away. The cluster of refineries birthed an equally large chemical industry. The Louisiana Governor John McKeithen <u>sought to draw industry to the region</u> in the 1960s by branding Louisiana as a “Right to Profit State,” <u>providing tacit support</u> for the decades-long fight against unions and the racial integration of the industry.

                        <li><u>reducing and ultimately ending subsidies and tax credits for fossil fuel exploration, processing, distribution and marketing.</u> Fossil fuel companies receive $20 billion annually from state and federal governments, which encourages them to “drill, baby, drill” in ever riskier areas without fear of losing profit. This system of subsidies and lax enforcement is facilitated by the close relationship between fossil fuel companies and the politicians they support. According to Oil Change International, “in the 2015-2016 election cycle oil, gas, and coal companies <u>spent $354 million in campaign contributions and lobbying </u> and received $29.4 billion in federal subsidies in total over those same years - an 8,200% return on investment.” Louisiana alone has nine different subsidies for oil and gas, which combined removed $322 million annually from tax revenue. For comparison, <u>the 2019 budget for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources was $60 million</u> and <u>the 2018 budget for the Department of Economic Development was $44 million.</u></li>

These residents of the Delta – like all their neighbors – deserve to count on good jobs. Given the future need for remediation and decommissioning at former sites of fossil fuel extraction, processing, storage and distribution, this transition to new jobs shouldn’t be hard, but will require intention and follow-through, as well as some re-training. One of the keys to this will be working with unions, one of the most important expressions collective will. <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/true-new-deal-for-the-covid-19-era/"> As the Roosevelt Institute has proposed</a>, sectoral bargaining could help achieve this at scale, rather than trying to implement job transitions site-by-site. </li>

               <h4>A just-transformation of the Delta</h4>
                <p>
                  The just-transformation of the Delta will serve as critical moment in the evolution of our country. As a region that has experienced centuries of exploitation, positioning the area on a trajectory aligned with the values of the Green New Deal will serve as a model for how the nation can repair historic injustices and transition to a new future through political, economic, and collectivist frameworks. Our implementation strategies which are built off the existing demands of organizers in the Delta, and others across the United States grappling with similar challenges, begin to illustrate incremental steps towards achieving the conditions outlined in the Green New Deal.</p>
                  <p>There are a host of institutions, grassroots organizations, politicians, and others that are already steering the region towards this vision. Aligning their respective missions will serve as a necessary step in creating a coalition-bloc powerful enough to dismantle the extractive ecosystem of moneyed interests while bridging new partnerships amongst disparate demographic groups within the Delta. Although racial divisions have always existed as a core organizing principle across the United States, this dynamic is particularly pronounced in the south where class divisions have been obscured by racialized systems of oppression that draw support from a broad swath of white constituencies. Syncing efforts like the Movement for Black Lives and Green New Deal provide a new paradigm to transcend class and racial differences through a set of economic and political advancements that benefit all of society. Other examples of this synergy include the Environmental and Climate Justice Program branch of the NAACP program, the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice and rising politicians like Cori Bush in Missouri. Ultimately, the task of engineering a just future for the country is a daunting but inspirational mission and the Delta can be on the forefront of overcoming nationwide issues by serving its own residents.
