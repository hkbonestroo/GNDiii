My mother taught me to love in the language of crab noodle soups, deep-fried spring rolls, and steaming pots full of phở bò. I could recognize her bún riêu cua anywhere, and I taste it in her mother’s recipe as well. We come from a culture that never questioned whether food was more than sustenance; we always knew it to be.

Have you eaten today? The words replace, how are you? They cross generations and even death itself. I see that in the fruit we lay on the altar every new moon and full moon, alongside a teacup and burning incense. I see it in the meticulously prepared meals laid out for tết, for death-days, for special occasions that we continue to share with our ancestors by cooking for them first.

I learned to love in the language of food, but the consequences of that ran deep; it also provided me with the tools for neglect. My relationship with food echoed my openness to the world and to myself. When I began to play around in the kitchen at nine years old, I made pizza, spaghetti Bolognese, and chocolate chip cookies. The foreign tastes made me who I wanted to be. I ate selectively. I groaned at dinnertime and told my mother to not bring any of her dishes to school. 

Then, at thirteen years old, when fat began to show on my hips, my thighs, and my stomach, I ate little at all. I could never stop the way self-love intertwined with food. They mirror each other like a dance. One plummets; the other follows. Years of skipped meals became a habit I still struggle to shake at the end of a hard day, a hard week, when I look up and realize that food had been the first thing to go.


When we fall, we go back to basics, back to the white rice spoon-fed to me by my mother, my grandmothers, and my aunts. The practice of nourishing myself became the foundation for growing my self-esteem. Timid at first, I clung on to staple dishes for safety. Then, I took more risks in life, and I took risks in food; I can no longer tell which one came first. Only retrospectively did I recognize the road to knowing myself had been lined with dishes along the way—first in the baby steps of instant noodle packages prepared how my father likes them and then in leaping strides of a Hungarian goulash on a chilly evening out.

&#38;nbsp;I asked my mother for her recipes then, but she told me they did not exist. She told me they lived in feeling, in tasting, in experience handed down. I tried to copy down a few words, but they felt empty without her hands on mine the first times I rolled a spring roll. She stood beside me when I learned to clean beef bones for phở. She taught me how to pick each vegetable apart. No shortcuts exist in love languages, so we spent hours speaking in our mother tongue.

Over and over, we practice the gestures passed across lifetimes – an intentional process of care that can always be recovered. As I healed and celebrated my body, I learned to nurture myself. As I embraced my roots after a dozen years of rejection, the longing for bún riêu cua brought me home, back to the stovetop where noodle soups bubbled, waiting for me.

Yellow Peril: Imagining East Asian futures in the West

	This past February, Love Intersections launched our debut visual arts exhibit, Yellow Peril; The Celestial Elements, at SUM Gallery — Canada’s only gallery with a queer mandate, located in Vancouver’s Chinatown. As queer East Asian artists, the show was a platform for us to imagine a future where our cultures flourished in the diaspora. The installation of four artworks —Channelling the Elements: an encounter of time/space, The Wall of Healing: a ‘Race’ Towards a Cosmic Future, Celestial Figurations, Audrey 1 (PJÄTTERYD) and Audrey 2 (PJÄTTERYD)— was a celebration of our identities, paying homage to our cultural traditions and bringing our ancestors into the present. 

None of us could have imagined the future that was to come less than a month later — and how the global pandemic would abruptly and violently alter the paths of our diasporic communities. Blaming us for the virus, anti-Asian hate crimes began spiking in and around the gallery as xenophobia and racism ran rampant. Things were looking dark.

The gallery was forced to close in mid-March when Phase 1 quarantine measures were put in place. We quickly adapted by concluding our exhibit with an online panel, Queerantine in Covid-19: Responding to the Yellow Peril Mutation. Alongside exhibition artists Kendell Yan, Jay Cabalu and Paul Wong, we discussed how the concept of the Yellow Peril has culturally mutated and that anti-Asian xenophobia and racism has always been present, in spite of the narratives surrounding Canadian multiculturalism. 

We also further explored how we can use art to imagine a future for queer East Asians communities, particuarly in the light of a post-coronavirus world. While this period has exacerbated anxiety and aggression, it has also energized action. Since the pandemic began, the world has finally been forced to reckon with the international movement for Black Lives, and the tireless work Indigenous land defenders, on and beyond Turtle Island, have and continue to do. 

As queer East Asians, the future we are envisioning must be seen through the kaleidoscopic lens of intersectionality. Now is the time for our communities to come together — even when we must be physically apart. With optimism today for a better tomorrow, there is light ahead.

What we have learned through the pandemic is that we are at the precipice of change, and that the perilous nature of a single virus was/is a kind of primer for the global uprising we are currently experiencing. Everything can change because everything has already changed — and while we continue to struggle against the systems that oppress us, we have the ability to regain a collective agency and autonomy. What was once deemed perilous to the machinations that uphold our broken world could in fact be a path towards revolution and the themes from Yellow Peril; The Celestial Elements might be a part of that utopian imagination.

I am watching my father's hands
He slams a mahjong tile and it cracks &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;  &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; like a chicken bone kissing the rickety table
Keefer Street is hotandnoisy
Memorial Plaza simmers &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;  &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; a clamour of shuffling
Aunties Uncles Youths
exclaiming in Toisan, in Cantonese, in English
and I remember myself
Sweat slips and sticks over the wet backsides of my knees and
I wish I were wearing a skirt 
In this foster body &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;  &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; this borrowed illusion, I am learning flesh 
I am descended of the richness of sweet red bean paste
I am the fragrance of salted fish and green onion
I am the softness and warmth of cha siu bao
And still
I have not yet inherited my body from my ancestors


I offer my struggles to hungry ghosts
Erect forty one shrines East of the Millennium gate
Vinyl portraits peeling limp from concrete&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; clinging to glass&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; climbing eagerly over plywood
I am plastered, tongueless, 
palms spread over graffiti hugging opioid scripture, 
languishing in the quiet heat on Pender Street and...
I wish I could slip life inside myself &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; 
Lips curled teeth grating fingers twist and thrust into acrid sidewalks
gnarled roots rip through asphalt, yearning for moonlight, 
I am the mud nourishing the pregnant lotus 
I am the yellow skin that falls from white pears, 
from my brown arms,
I am my father's hands, &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; and still
I have not yet inherited my body from my ancestors
But I would like to,
Finally


I am watching my father's hands
He slams a mahjong tile and it cracks &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; like a chicken bone kissing the rickety table

I am descended of the richness of sweet red bean paste
I am the fragrance of salted fish and green onion
I am the softness and warmth of cha siu bao
And still
I have not yet inherited my body from my ancestors


I am growing my hair to be long like Ngin Ngin’s
Hungry ghosts gnaw at the knots&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; leaving a clean edge to weave my body forward
Each strand an offering, every struggle a tribute
In honour of my inheritance&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp; I erect forty one shrines East of the Millennium Gate

THE TOKYO AESTHETIC: DISPATCHES FROM THE STREETS OF FASHION WEEK

I first visited Japan in 2014 and was stunned by the eclectic streetwear. Between takoyakis or taiyakis, I roamed the streets and covered the fashion weeks at the end of October. I decided to move to Japan in 2016 to capture the fashionable spirit of the young, incredibly interesting individuals who treated the pavement like a runway. While I returned to Montreal after my year-long visa expired, the trip made a lasting impression on me, as well as my photographic style. 

I went back in 2019 to work on a personal project and couldn’t help but sync up my trip with October Fashion Week. Now, as this year’s (digital) Fashion Week has come and gone, I can’t help but reminisce about the ultra-cool people I met there and the personal styles that continue to inspire me.

One of my biggest takeaways from past trips is that Japanese thrift culture is on another level entirely. I love thrifting in Tokyo. You can find old “grails” and amazing vintage finds. Plus, it’s more sustainable. Areas like Shimokitazawa are full of vintage stores: military and pre ‘80s designers. Koenji for punk and metal. Shibuya or Shinjuku offer more recent designers. That’s why the streets are a mix of luxury items and well-worn vintage. I’ve seen jeans resown as a coat, denim over double-breasted jackets, and expertly-mixed patterns that Japanese designers - like Sacai, Comme des Garcons, and Needles - have mastered.

Here are a few pictures of the young trailblazers I met: from students and actors to art directors and hairstylists. You can find any style in Tokyo. And that’s why it's a must-visit city for anyone who appreciates fashion.

When things get rough, the reflex is to try and patch things up quickly. Sometimes a step back creates an angle that offers you a wider perspective; a crucial viewpoint in the face of adversity. Of course, I wouldn’t be able to make these statements today if it wasn’t for the years I spent practicing the art of boxing. So many parallels can be drawn between what happens inside the sparring ring, and life lived beyond the ropes. The quarantine, especially, has made space for some serious reflection. I think back to Christian; the introverted kid who avoided conflict, even while fires burned around him. Now, as Coach Chris, I keep those fires in check, and stoke the right ones when the moment calls for it.

As a trainer and coach, I owe my success to the people I’ve met along the way, namely Herby Whyne, owner of the iconic Hard Knox Gym. The best way to understand this guy’s spirit is by walking through the gym itself. You’ll first notice the rastafari influences with reds, yellows, and greens that cover the rustic-looking gym. Herby will probably greet you with a joke—the environment creating an undeniable feeling of positivity. 

Hard Knox works like a small-business. In Herby’s words, “If ten people come in and only one person ends up signing up, that’s who I want anyways”. For him, it was never about getting all the customers, nor the big money. This former Kickboxing champion built his reputation through word-of-mouth. He knows what he wants: to be surrounded by people who share his sense of humour and who understand his values. Earlier this year, he was inspired to make donations like sleeping bags and gift cards for those without a roof over their head when the pandemic struck Montreal. It’s these little things that keep the gym authentic. It’s why it’s kept its heart, from when the doors first opened, until now.

Today, he’s still the role model and friend who taught me to not make excuses for myself in a time when I could not yet understand my place in the world. When I started to pick up boxing, under his guidance, I knew I wanted to learn how to fight. Little did I know, boxing taught me to take accountability for myself. Because boxing is sweat. Boxing is learning how to stand steady and ground yourself—even when your legs are shaking and your heart is pounding out of your chest. It’s about hard work, dedication and determination. The sparring ring became a space where I would eventually evolve as a competitor; the ground that would form me into the teacher I am today. The coach-trainee relationship, itself, has the potential to evolve into a more sacred bond. There’s a particular kind of trust that is built when someone is allowed to securely throw a punch at me or when they learn how to defend themselves against my jab. At the end of the day, the thing that allows me to wake up at six A.M. and to get through my day, twelve hours later, is the reward of helping people build their self-confidence. Working with motivated people is what keeps me in this business–we feed off each others’ positive energies. That’s how you create and empower a community.&#38;nbsp;




	“Because boxing is sweat. Boxing is learning how to stand steady and ground yourself—even when your legs are shaking and your heart is pounding out of your chest.”





	
	
	
I wanted to shed some light on the accomplishments of other fellow Asian fighters, people who also understand the power of discipline and commitment. I invited actress Orphée Ladouceur-Nguyen, Richard Ho, owner of the renowned H2O MMA school of martial arts, and Ariane Dang, one of his star pupils, to share their thoughts on their practice.



	




Orphée Ladouceur-Nguyen

	Orphée was introduced to the world of martial arts at seven years old. The streets of the neighborhood she grew up in were not the safest. Learning how to defend herself became an asset, which is why her mother decided to enroll herself, Orphée, and her brother in after-school taekwondo lessons. Their decision paid off in ways that exceeded expectations: on top of having success on the regional and national scenes, Orphée would end up scoring a spot on the national team in 2005 and completing a training camp in Seoul. She went on to place third in her weight division during the 2005 Taekwondo World Championship in Madrid. Today, the mixed Vietnamese-Quebecer actress and stunt woman appears in popular series such as the second season of the Netflix series Altered Carbon, Titans, Arrow, and a variety of French Canadian shows.


01/ What goes into the preparation of your roles as a stuntwoman? Can you let us in on your training routine?

Orphée: My job requires me to always be on my A-game. I never really know when I will book a job, nor what the expectations will be, so I have to maintain my physique on a daily basis and upkeep my skills. I do a lot of strength and conditioning as well as skills training with my partner Alex Stines who also happens to be a stunt actor and an MMA coach. Together, we practice different martials arts, weapons training, fight choreography, gymnastics, yoga and other mobility exercises.


02/ What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?

O: I would advise them to make sure that they are really committed to the journey. The most important thing is to love the process, because no matter how hard you train in this business, there is no guarantee that you will land the jobs you want. You have to be able to find joy in the learning and the training, not only because it is something “you have to do” to get hired. There are so many contingencies in the career of an actor or stunt performer that are out of your control. Being able to accept this and not take rejection too personally makes it so that you don’t let these setbacks get the best of you. Also, keeping a professional attitude will most likely get you where you want to be. And ultimately, being a player in a project or a team is a collaborative effort: it is not only about you. I try to ask myself how I can add value to a particular role or project.


03/ You got a degree in journalism before deciding to work in the movie industry as a full-time job. When was the pivotal moment for you?

O: Funny enough, it was actually missing out on a role as a mutant on X-men that motivated me to finally take the leap. I was so close&#38;nbsp; (laughs)! Even though I didn’t end up getting it, it sparked the belief that I could really do this. Even though it was scary to drop everything else and commit myself fully to this career, I knew this was how I was going to make things happen for me.


04/ How have martial arts helped you grow as a person?

O: My 26 years of experience in taekwondo forged who I am today. I grew up as a shy and reserved girl. Throughout the years, the discipline inherent to the martial arts training helped me overcome the hurdles along the way and gave me more self-confidence; it undeniably made me more mentally resilient because nobody was going to do it for me. I had to become my own best friend along the way. And at the end of the day, I learned that I can’t be too hard on myself and have to pick myself up whenever I fall. I learned my most valuable lessons from failing, actually. This growth mindset will follow me throughout the rest of my life, which I am extremely grateful for. 


05/ Who were your role models growing up?

O: I always admired people who seemed effortlessly good at what they did, being masters of their own craft. I never really had idols per say but I really liked Jackie Chan. My guilty pleasure was the first Rush Hour movie. I enjoyed how they added a comical flare to the seriousness of martial arts. Everything he did was so impressive to me and he looked like he was having so much fun!

Inspired by martial arts movies &#38;amp; a thirst for knowledge, Richard Ho’s success story began when he got his hands on a copy of UFC 2, an event that pinned martial artists from all different styles against each other in real fights to see whose style would come out on top. This introduced him to the effectiveness of MMA &#38;amp; Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), a grappling martial arts form that uses leverage &#38;amp; techniques to overcome size and strength. This newfound knowledge was enough to fuel Richard’s passion, which soon led him from practicing in his basement to winning multiple BJJ Tournaments, to winning two Canadian MMA Titles held by UGC (Ultimate Generation Combat). Today he is not only a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt, but the Head Coach and proud owner of the H2O MMA gym.&#38;nbsp; 

01/ Can you tell us about your earlier role models growing up? 

Richard: My father was a great role model for me. He came from a small village with no money and not much opportunity, but through hard work he obtained a PhD, started his own successful business, Horium Foods, and also became a leader in the Asian community here in Canada, having founded the Montreal Metropolitan Chinese School. I think, as a kid, I always felt his leadership, hard work and entrepreneurship which definitely influenced my own career. 


02/ What happened after you found that UFC tape that would introduce you to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?

R: No one really knew what Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was at the time. This guy [Royce Gracie] was about 170lbs (the smallest person in the tournament) and faced other competitors that were almost 300lbs. Within seconds he would have these guys on the ground panicking and eventually tapping out. This really intrigued me and I instantly got hooked and started studying and training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu &#38;amp; MMA, with dreams of one day fighting in the UFC. 



03/ Can you talk a little bit about when you decided to go pro?

R: It was all about passion. I had a decision to make after I finished University: to go into a field where I’m going to be sitting in front of a computer all day, but potentially make more money, or to follow my passion in the martial arts and try to realize my dream of becoming a UFC fighter like Royce Gracie. I chose the latter option and I couldn’t be happier.&#38;nbsp; Not only did I become a MMA Champion twice, I also realized my dream to be in the UFC, not as a fighter, but as a Coach. I realized this was my calling: it brought me to my current profession as a full time MMA coach and owner of H2O MMA. The gym has grown to be one of the biggest &#38;amp; best MMA Gyms in North America, where I’m able to share my passion for Kickboxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to everyone from beginners all the way to the best pros in the world. &#38;nbsp;

04/ You used to watch tapes of UFC superstars as a kid. Now you’re actually working with them as a coach.&#38;nbsp; One of your students Olivier Aubin Mercier was ranked in the UFC’s top 15.&#38;nbsp; What’s that been like?

R: Coaching at the UFC has definitely been one of the highlights of my career. And to see one of my students reach the top 15 in the UFC’s lightweight division, known to be the toughest division in the world, was a truly proud moment. I am blessed to work with all these amazing fighters, from Olivier Aubin-Mercier to my good friend Georges St. Pierre, arguably the best UFC fighter of all time. At the end of the day, you realize they [UFC fighters] are just normal people like you and I. They put in the hard work and they become successful in their craft. It’s a huge pleasure to spend time with these fighters while sharing our knowledge and our stories.&#38;nbsp; Hard work and passion is the key to everything.






Ariane Dang

	Ariane Dang is a 27 years-old mechanical engineer who has been practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu for almost a decade. A couple of years ago, Ariane attended one of the Women’s ‘Open Mat’ that H2O MMA would host every Sunday night. This became her stepping stone into H20’s competing team with Richard Ho as her coach. Years later, she earned her purple belt and has repeatedly been crowned champion in her last seven years of competing. “Martial arts helped me become my true self”, she says.

01/ Can you tell us how you got into jiu-jitsu?

Ariane: I remember stumbling upon Youtube videos of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy. Even before studying to become a mechanical engineer, I liked to understand the human body and its movements. I was fascinated by the fact that by using the right technique, smaller people were able to dominate much larger opponents. Being a self-learner, I bought my first tapes and started doing my homework. But after a month, it became clear to me that I needed professionnel help to perfect my technique which led me to sign up in martial arts. 

02/ When you first started practicing jiu-jitsu, were there other women in your classes?

A: No! I was the only girl in the gym for a very very long time. But I think it was better that way, because they were giving me more time and more attention. The gym owner made sure he always had my back. If I were to spar with a bigger guy, he was always watching to make sure that the guy wasn’t going too hard. 

03/ At what point did women become more interested in this sport?

A: The rise of Rhonda Rousey helped the movement, that’s for sure. The popularity of UFC had a big effect in the recognition of the jiu-jitsu community. I’ve also seen a lot of self-defense classes for women popping up all over the world. At this point, the more women represent jiu-jitsu at our gym, the easier it is for other young girls and women to join the crew. When they come in and they see a purple belt, a brown belt, a black belt, it gives them hope. They can also see smaller girls rolling with bigger guys and throwing them to the ground. It’s powerful. 

04/ What has been your biggest accomplishment so far?

A: Richard and I did this free women's self defence seminar and we gathered 120 women. To me, that was a triumph! Going into it, I thought “if I can impact at least one woman, just give her a bit more confidence in herself, then I did a good job”. We ended up having a blast!

05/ How has your jiu-jitsu practice impacted your life?

A: The sport of combat has definitely given me more self-confidence. I’m no longer scared to walk into a new situation. In that sense, it’s opened many doors to new opportunities. Also, the world of jiu-jitsu is so welcoming and supportive. Whenever I travel abroad and train in a MMA gym, it always feels like I’m training among family members. It’s a really special feeling to be a part of something bigger than myself.&#38;nbsp;

Antares Yee







	
	

I first met Antares Yee, the creative director at Sun at Six, in the summer of 2018 in New York City, after the then 27-year old launched his studio’s second collection of furniture. Sun at Six, Antares’s furniture design studio in Brooklyn, is a joint venture between a mother and son. The home furnishings are made of Italian leather and sustainably sourced white oak, and are assembled with the care of traditional Chinese joinery masters. This technique is called sun mao (榫卯)—a fading artform that is known and practiced by few. All pieces from their collection are developed in close collaboration with craftsmen in Guangzhou, China. The premise of the studio centres around the way design and space can impact how you feel, specifically the emotional impact and influence of context and design intent. 

That same year, President Donald Trump began what is now the China-United States Trade War—imposing tariffs and trade barriers on China. Citing unfair trading practices, the new tariffs were claimed to encourage the consumption of American-made goods by making imports more costly. Despite this, many homegrown businesses like Sun at Six either manufacture or partially run production overseas and suffer as a result. Tariff policy changes were also felt in Mexico and Canada this summer with the implementation of the new iteration of NAFTA, titled the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA). 

Fast forward two years, Sun at Six is carried at Design Within Reach, A/D/O, and furnishes the Glossier HQ, while the US approaches a monumental presidential election. As a business owner in the US working with craftsmen in China, there exists no separation between art and politics. Over video, some 400 miles between my Toronto apartment and his Brooklyn home, Antares and I chat about the influence of his Chinese heritage on the furniture design studio, the relationship between space, design, and the mind, and the balancing act of being in business in today’s climate.

	01/ You were born and raised in Santa Cruz, California, where your mother and father own an established furniture company. How did that shape who you’ve become?




My mom runs the furniture company and my dad technically works for her. Growing up in that world, I thought furniture was lame and boring. I spent most of my childhood in warehouses climbing on boxes and in furniture stores with my eyes glazed over. At that point, I saw furniture as functional; a place to eat dinner. It was like a doorknob—you just use it to open a door. It wasn’t like how we conceive of art objects today. I didn’t connect furniture to being a creative endeavour until I was in my early twenties. That said, my upbringing showed me the gritty, scrappy nature of running a small business—the mentality and sacrifice required, which I now realize not everyone was exposed to.




02/ When and how did you realize that design would also be your career?



I realized in college I wanted to become a designer. It was the closest job available to me related to visual culture. Visual culture always spoke to me and I think, even in art, I was really just driven by it and nothing else. However, I never had much to say beyond finding a personally gratifying way to react to contemporary visual culture in my work. It wasn’t clear to me exactly what I wanted to do, and coming from an immigrant background, I really had no idea what the design world was like or that a design world even existed. At that time, I saw that jobs as a digital designer existed and that was a better lead than anything else. I honestly had no idea other design professions were even available to me. 

I helped my mom design furniture and would look over her work, but it wasn’t until the last 5 or 6 years that the idea of art/object became sexy or that I saw objects as expressions of design sensibility. Coming to New York also expanded my vision of design and possibilities — furniture became a canvas to design something with. Having worked in digital design, I wanted to get out of the digital world and into the physical, experiential world. I wanted to cut my teeth and prove myself. With the background and expertise of my family, furniture design felt like the perfect place to do my own thing.




	
	03/ In 2017, you founded Sun at Six with your mother. Tell me about venturing into business with family. 



It was stressful. I’ve seen all the impositions this makes on family relationships by seeing my mom and dad work together and I really wanted no part of that. I assumed that if we created Sun at Six completely separate from her business and I ran it as a separate entity, it would make things easier. This is true, and I think Sun at Six succeeded because its perspective is from a different generation immersed in a different culture. That said, the stresses and challenges of working with family were more present than I expected. It’s not easy and you’re constantly fighting battles every day. I learnt to pick my battles.
	



	“The more that Americans viscerally see Chinese people — faces, families, favorite foods, walking in the park on Saturday morning — the better our odds are of fighting the political narrative we see in the media of “China” being some unknown, hostile trade adversary.”





	
	04/ The artisans of the collection are rooted in Guangzhou, China and use a traditional Chinese joinery technique that is fading. What motivated you to preserve this craftsmanship? 




It comes from the “Made in China” stereotypes and Chinese stereotypes in the United States. China has such a rich history of intricate craft — in direct contrast to Japan’s minimalism. China has always been known for its incredible intricacy and complexity in design. There are thousands of years of expertise and craft, passed from generation to generation, and Chinese joinery is one such example. It was Chinese joinery systems that inspired Japanese joinery.Especially in the face of today’s political climate and racism that Chinese people face in the United States, it’s particularly important to push these artforms and highlight the humanity of individual people that not everyone has had a chance to interact with personally. It’s a lot easier for an American to empathize with an Australian on the other side of the world, who speaks the same language and is more culturally accessible than a Chinese speaker in a country whom we have little cultural access to. The language and cultural barriers make it easy for hawks and politicians to push convenient narratives without repercussions. The more that Americans viscerally see Chinese people—faces, families, favourite foods, walking in the park on Saturday morning—the better our odds are of fighting the political narrative we see in the media of “China” being some unknown, hostile trade adversary.

	05/ The premise of Sun at Six is around the concept of design and spaces enabling the mind. Why is that manifesto at the core of your business?




Every space has a purpose, whether we’re aware of it or not. Some people arrange living rooms for lounging, others to focus and do work. For us, the key to making sure a room succeeds is how you feel when using it. If you want to work in your living room, you better make sure the design choices you make facilitate focus. To that end, we think about how our pieces make you feel and how they can help put you in the right mindset — for sleep, relaxation, focus, etc. We focus on how your furniture makes you feel in that specific space while making sure it aligns with the mindset you want. We aim to evoke feelings of gentleness, calm, and nourishment in every piece we design. A lot of our cues are taken from nature to expand your senses: smell, sight, touch.



06/ What are some of the challenges or fears you’ve had to overcome with Sun at Six? 




With a small studio, you face a new challenge every day. At first it was, “Who is even going to buy one of these things?” There was a lot of doubt. Why would anyone buy one of our pieces when there are so many options out there? Once the initial pieces sold, the joy was immediately replaced by the next challenge: how do we make enough money to sustain ourselves? Then we faced larger questions like how do we deal with Trump’s tariffs? How do we deal with complex shipping logistics? How do we deal with a pandemic? It’s a new curve ball every day. It feels like everytime you take a step forward, a new problem gets thrown at you—rinse and repeat. It keeps things fresh, but it can be a lot to deal with. You don’t really get a break.
 

	

	
“If you go about your business and pretend you’re separating politics from craft, you’re actively supporting the existing structures and systems put in place, and supporting those with power now.”




	
	07/ It feels as though time has paused in the past six months. How have the recent events influenced the way you think, act, and/or live? 



It’s profoundly affected my thoughts about my own goals on how I relate to society, my place in this society, and what I want from my life. What even is the value of high-end furniture design given the circumstances with COVID, racial justice, and income inequality? How does what I do relate to these circumstances? It’s hard to know what direction to take the studio, what its role is, and what my own role is.

Despite this, current events have pushed people to think about where they buy and who they buy from. Consumers are now more open to sustainability and helping small businesses. Leaders are pushed to think of their impact on capitalism and use their platform or resources to create positive change. There is a collective effort to mobilize your thoughts, efforts, and money into something positive.
	

	




	
	08/ As a business owner and creative, do you believe in the separation of politics from craft?




Every act is political. To be “apolitical” is to take a political stance in support of the status quo. If you go about your business and pretend you’re separating politics from craft, you’re actively supporting the existing structures and systems put in place, and supporting those with power now.




09/ Lately, where have you drawn inspiration from and what do you enjoy most about the creative process?



Lately, I’ve been thinking about our photography. We just shot in the same place along the Pacific Coast in California that we shoot every year, but this year huge swaths were engulfed by flames. Thinking about how to represent the charred landscape and the devastating fires has opened some new doors in terms of photography and messaging.As far as the creative process, the most exciting part for me is when you’re about to see the final result — the first time you see a finished chair, an edited photo. My stomach usually drops in the moments leading up. Most often I’m disappointed, but there’s nothing like seeing results that you’re proud of. When the results exceed my expectations, those are some of the best moments for sure.

	Entrevue

UNE INVITATION AUX ASIATIQUES À PRENDRE LA VIE DOUCEMENT

Une conversation avec Laura Nhem
Article et photo par David Trang

	&#60;img width="3540" height="4420" width_o="3540" height_o="4420" data-src="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/a195e2eb4e3661d325efe161e925008543a31782f4b46aaa00ff3d478f52eec9/Laura-NB-3.JPG" data-mid="85956188" border="0"  src="https://freight.cargo.site/w/1000/i/a195e2eb4e3661d325efe161e925008543a31782f4b46aaa00ff3d478f52eec9/Laura-NB-3.JPG" /&#62;Laura Nhem






	
	Qu’est-ce qu’on dirait à notre plus jeune version de nous? Il semble que cette question vient nous chercher davantage plus qu’on vieillit. Des mots d’encouragement, des vérités qui sont autant difficiles à vivre qu’à entendre, des mots doux pour apaiser ce que le jeune toi vivait à cette époque… Si l’on pouvait magiquement envoyer un message de l’âge adulte à notre jeunesse, on prendrait tous la vie un peu plus doucement - ce n’est pas difficile à admettre.
Pour Laura Nhem, ce qu’elle aurait voulu entendre lorsqu’elle était adolescente, elle l’a créé sous forme de podcast, Asiate Imparfaite / Imperfect Asian : des discussions de fond avec des asiatiques comme elle; imparfaite. “Je me suis dit : “Moi, quand j’étais adolescente, qu’est-ce qui m’aurait fait du bien?”. Je voulais aider les autres et moi-même à se sentir moins seul.e.s et à mieux comprendre leurs émotions, leurs vécus, leurs histoires”. 




	“Mon podcast ne va pas révolutionner le monde, mais si ça peut changer la vie de quelques personnes, ça me va. Je veux juste que le projet existe et que les voix et les histoires de mes invitées soient entendus et ressentis.”




	
	
Le projet Asiate Imparfaite est né suite à des rencontres et des discussions que Laura a eues et la COVID était le moment d’arrêt qu’il fallait pour concrétiser les choses. C’est avec son ami Emmanuel Hessler que Laura a lancé son projet de podcast, dans le but d’éliminer la peur d’être médiocre. “Je lui disais que je voulais encourager les gens à faire des choses, des projets, et de ne pas avoir peur d’être médiocre. La médiocrité est partout. Alors pourquoi avoir peur de partir un projet? S’il y a de la place pour des choses médiocres, il y a de la place pour moi qui fait des choses normales, il y a de la place pour tout le monde.”

	La carrière de Laura n’a rien de médiocre. Elle est décoratrice en cinéma à temps plein et baigne dans le milieu depuis 10 ans. Cette avenue créative vient d’une affirmation de soi, qu’elle a depuis son tout jeune âge. Que ce soit la rébellion qu’elle a eue auprès de ses parents plus jeune à l’école ou dans sa vingtaine, pour se détacher de la pression de devoir rentrer dans le “moule asiatique” ou simplement dans sa vie de tous les jours, en mettant ses limites et en se respectant elle-même et les autres.

Bien établie aujourd’hui, elle a aussi l’assurance de travailler quand elle sent que c’est un bon moment et n’hésite pas à arrêter lorsqu’elle n’a pas envie de travailler. “J’y vais vraiment avec un flow de comment je me sens dans le présent. Ça a toujours fonctionné. J’ai toujours dit oui aux bonnes personnes et j’ai dit non aux gens que je ne feelais pas - parce que je ne voulais pas ressentir cette pression de tout le temps travailler.” 

Pour Laura, ce n’est pas le travail qui la définit comme humain.

“Je ne suis pas carriériste, malgré que j’adore mon travail; j’aime travailler, rencontrer de nouvelles personnes, faire de la recherche, lire les scénarios, designer des choses, magasiner… mais ce n’est pas ça qui me définit. Ce qui me définit, c’est les relations que j’ai avec les gens que j’aime. En réalité, je n’ai pas de gros objectifs dans la vie; mon seul objectif c’est d’être une bonne amie et le reste c’est de l’extra.”
Comment son podcast l’aide à devenir une meilleure version d’elle-même et pour ses relations? “Ça m’aide à être empathique. Ça me fait questionner sur comment moi je vois les choses et le tout reste humain, sans être dans l’activisme. Et c’est ça qui me représente le plus. J’ai choisi des personnes qui avaient des idées différentes et avec qui j’avais une facilité à être intime. Et chaque invité a fait ressortir quelque chose (une émotion, une réaction) chez moi. Ça m’a donné l’espace d’exprimer des côtés de moi que je n’avais pas eu la chance de vivre.”

	Nous avons discuté de long en large sur le fait de rentrer dans le moule de l’asiatique parfait, des attentes familiales pour la première génération d’enfants au Canada, des attentes sociétales quand on est asiatique; que ce soit au niveau académique ou du travail. C’était important pour Laura de mettre la lumière sur des asiatiques imparfaits, principalement car on ne connaît pas de modèles asiatiques qui ont réussi, autres que dans des domaines académiques, problème issu du racisme systémique qu’on connaît. “Nos possibilités semblent être restreintes par les règles de la société, qui veulent entre autres que les asiatiques ne soient pas des artistes. Le “moule”, c’est un moule qu’on a créé avec les attentes sociétale et familiale. Quand on est dans une société occidentale, il y a tellement de possibilités, mais quand une personne vient d’une société comme celle du Cambodge, il n’y a pas tant de possibilités que ça. Si tu es une femme, tu te maries jeune, t’as des enfants, il faut que tu trouves une stabilité pour ta famille. C’est une réalité encore au Cambodge et c’est une réalité dans d’autres parties du monde mais pas ici au Canada. 

Inconsciemment, on suit ces règles; Nous ne sommes pas artistes, mais nous sommes reconnus pour être bons académiquement. Parfois, je jugeais les asiatiques qui suivaient cette ligne droite. En fait, j’admire les gens qui recherchent cette stabilité, mais ça n’a jamais été pour moi. Ça a fait en sorte que j’ai eu beaucoup de difficulté à essayer de trouver ma place dans la société.” (Notre première édition à Sticky rice portait justement sur cette “minorité modèle”.

Puis en développant son projet de podcast, ça a donné la chance à Laura de creuser dans ces sujets avec d’autres gens comme elle. Elle abordera notamment le sujet de la sexualité dans les familles asiatiques et nos identités, de l’immigration de nos parents au Canada, et parlera de vulnérabilité, des moments difficiles de nos vies, de l’expression de soi et de trouver notre communauté peu importe où on est. Le projet est né naturellement et parallèlement et lui a amené beaucoup de bien. “Ce qu’on vit / a vécu reste un processus qui va prendre toute notre vie à absorber, on ne va jamais être en paix avec ce qu’on vit, mais il y a une façon de le vivre qui peut être un peu plus doux et je voulais amener cette douceur-là chez les autres.” 

J’ai beaucoup appris et grandir au travers des discussions que j’ai eues avec Laura et à l’écoute des épisodes du podcast Asiate imparfaite. Tel était son but, je me suis moi-même senti moins seul dans ma situation d’être un cambodgien né à Montréal qui ne suit pas le moule imposé par la société. Malgré les dualités qu’on peut vivre; s’écouter vs. plaire aux attentes de nos parents, suivre son instinct vs. être ce que la société veut qu’on soit, s’exprimer ou se taire, créer ou suivre; j’apprends aussi à être plus doux avec la personne que je suis et l’héritage que j’ai.

TO HARNESS YOUR INNER LIGHT: UP CLOSE WITH LIA

An intimate conversation with singer, songwriter, producer, LIA

	Although it’s LIA’s first time inside a karaoke box, she looks unfazed by the multicoloured light specks sprayed onto her face—lasers deflected from a suspended central disco ball overlooking the obscure private room. Muted Korean pop videos loop on the wall-mounted karaoke television, distracting us from the awkward – yet comfortable – tan leather couches that decorate the dimly lit space. We spend the next sixty minutes on a variety of topics, including the inspiration behind her latest EP, Vasilia. Over a seering pot of green tea, we contemplate the future of the internet as we talk about the Behind My Eyes video, in which she is featured alongside the Montreal-based music producer Apashe. In the futuristic video, LIA sings about keeping quiet in order to protect another’s pride. She appears dressed in all white as multiple video projections on billboards displayed above Tokyo’s neon-lit towers, but her real body rests on a blue felt sofa, this time her white outfit matches the emptiness of the room.

	Viet: Can you tell us more about the idea behind the busy cinematic piece? 
LIA: When Adrian Villagomez approached me with the idea for the video, he wanted to explore loneliness, the contrast between the virtual world and the real world, and to make a statement about how people can embody an alternative self in a digital realm–a result of people having moved their lives online out of necessity. What we see in the projection is a version of what we could be in the future. 

V: Indeed, people have been migrating to the virtual world, lately.

L: A lot of people our age have been gradually moving towards freelance work from homw. They’ve been taking advantage of this kind of lifestyle even before COVID-19 and now it has become the standard.


	

	
	V: Are you saying that the image that people put out on the internet is in any way a representation of how they want to see themselves in the future?

L: The person you present tends to be the person you become over time. There is a journal article written by Amy Schlosser that was recently published; a literature review about self-presentation versus self-disclosure on social media. She was looking at how the person we present online, even if we act differently, ends up converging with our true selves. The relationship between self-presentation and self-disclosure isn’t mutually exclusive–it was observed before the advent of social media and repeats itself there too. People are taking sexualized pictures or creating caricatured versions of themselves online, it’s in some way incorporated into their subconscious. You see some people writing in all caps and posting a bunch of stuff when in real life they are quite timid. It’s easier for them to try things out online before trying them out in real life.

V: Do you see that as a good thing?

L: Mmm….social media is performative and I think we end up doing a lot of things that we wouldn’t do in person. What we choose to do on social media is not really candid, so we end up overthinking, editing how we would like to see ourselves, whereas, in person, you have no choice but to make mistakes. It's part of being human.
	

	

	
	V: There’s a high standard that we set for ourselves on social media. I feel like we need to continue learning how to be spontaneous and authentic in the “real” world. Otherwise, we never learn how to make those mistakes through real-life experiences.
L: And learning from dealing with different personalities and different situations.

	The songstress-producer learned to navigate the social world feeling like the odd one out on both sides of her family, “too Asian for my White family, and too White for my Asian family”, she says, making for a sometimes conflicting sense of self, growing up in the suburbs of Maryland. Although she went through highschool living the classic American experience – being actively involved in the student committee, cheering for homecoming kings and queens – she was always aware of how her mixed Japanese-American heritage played out in her immediate environment. The repercussions of the 1940s internment of Japanese-Americans were felt inside her household. L: After WWII, my grandparents didn’t want to maintain a strong attachment to the Japanese culture so it wasn’t passed down to my dad and then barely to me. So anything I do learn about Japan, I cherish. And I hold onto the details, hoping that one day I’m going to do a pilgrimage-esque trip to Hiroshima where my family is from and find the archives of who they were in the 1800s and why they took the big risk of working on the sugar cane plants on Oahu and Maui and be in a completely foreign land. I always feel so proud of being Japanese, yet I feel so far away from my heritage. I am always trying to find ways to get closer to it.


V: Yet you are inherently Japanese-American in your own way, like how you pick up on things in your father’s communication style without it being explicitly said (laughs).

L: Definitely with regards to things that revolve around shame, like shame in asking for help, in displaying emotions at times, in disappointing your family, shame in mismanaging your money (laughs), all these things that ring so true in Asian households. 


  

	




	





	“In the fairytale, if the men try to trap the light of these wood nymph-like creatures, they are transformed into moths. Then, they’re attracted to their light for their whole life.”




	
	V: I want to talk about your latest EP, Vasilia. The name, itself, is based on the Russian fairytale, Vasilisa.

L: Yes, I made it more me with a twist in the name, Vasilia. Vasilisa was presented with a challenge to get light from a woods witch named Baba Yaga and she had to pass these tests. She eventually succeeds with dawn, day and night by her side. Because the witch saw that the universe was on her side, she decided not to eat her and instead gave her the light. I had this old 90s computer game called Baba Yaga And The Magic Geese and I remember how I had always appreciated the aesthetic of Slavic folk tales. I eventually fell upon Uldus Bakhtiozina who is a photographer, stylist, and film director now. I loved how dark and beautiful her style was and I wanted to draw inspiration from her. I remember going through a rough time, being messy and drinking too much. I was dating people who were emotionally unavailable. During this time, I was making these demos and writing these lyrics, so I felt like the Vasilisa fairy tale resonated with where I was at in my emotional maturity. The album itself is about following my path through resilience.


V:  We live in a time in which we are very much aware of mental health issues, but we are not as well-versed in cultivating resilience. What does this word mean to you?

L: It means persevering against all odds. It means feeling sad and getting out of it. It means initially accepting love from people who are not good for you, and then putting a stop to it and being like “I love myself too much for this''. Another part of resilience is also like you’re collecting mechanisms along the way so that you can be stronger after the supposed struggle. I wanted to talk about femininity in my track Kissel Shore, it's a hymn for the land of women. It's like a promised land, a magic land, in Slavic folk tale. So I imagined it as a land where you can’t fuck with these women or else they’ll turn you into a moth and they’ll trap you for life. In the fairytale, if the men try to trap the light of these wood nymph-like creatures, they are transformed into moths. Then, they’re attracted to their light for their whole life. So I wanted to talk about resilience as a woman, in my mental health, and in my heart.

LIA’s sultry voice hums over bell sounds and shuffling noises – it smoothly envelops the listener and accompanies them through the sonic landscape of her record. Her body of work evokes cinematic imagery and incorporates elements of trip-hop. “If I had to sum it up into one phrase, it would be like experimental pop, but I don’t feel like this is right. I hate how, when you have to pitch yourself, you have to boil yourself down to two words because you miss so many nuances. Like I do have acoustic songs, I do have a drum and bass song. I have breakbeats. It’s mostly electronic, though.” 
But she didn't always produce electronic music. She recalls coming to Montreal at 18 years old to study in the Economics and the Earth’s Environment program at McGill University. She did not feel enthusiastic about electronic music then, but that was before she started dabbling into the world of Soundcloud. This was also around the time when she decided to leave her debauched university parties aside to focus on music and projects that nourished her creative spirit after having met with the producers that would later introduce her to sound engineering, the kind of work that can “turn paper ripping into a cool sound”, she says. 

She does, however, maintain her close relationship with the environment in her upcoming work, which comes naturally to her having grown up in an Earth-conscious household. 

L: Since I was a baby, I had an Earth’s Day poster hanging in my room. My parents always bought organic and took me on a bunch of hikes, giving me a true appreciation for nature. So, it felt natural when I was trying to decide what career I wanted to go down to explore environmental science. [...] I’m working on an album right now. It’s like what Mother Earth would say if she could speak. So it's examining our relationship as humans with our natural environment and the earth. And it’s pretty sad in terms of lyrics. It’s about pain and betrayal. It’s also about mothering and nurturing.

At her request, I play the dance remixes of AK Akemi Kakihara, the Japanese pop singer who she met at Key &#38;amp; Needles Studios in Brooklyn, where she happened to be while visiting her friend Spencer, the studio owner. She remembers being struck by the older Japanese pop artist’s ageless beauty as she walked into the studio, looking for a place to record. As the house music breaks through the silence and progresses, the room feels like it takes on a shade of gold. AK’s sensual voice repeats “Say that you love me” over percussions in the background. LIA does not waste time for the photoshoot. Wearing all red, a reliable colour of hers, she throws herself onto a leather couch, requiring little direction. Although it's LIA’s first time in a karaoke box, she exudes a calm confidence, embodying a femininity that is both free and in control.

ART VS. INJUSTICE: CATCHING UP WITH ALBERT NGUYEN

Art director and graphic designer Albert Nguyen on his contribution to the Sticky Rice pagoda fundraiser, the creative process, and everything in between.

	&#60;img width="2043" height="2888" width_o="2043" height_o="2888" data-src="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/708d79a96d23ef5cbc65e253fe70c8824e278f3086f705947e852a801dc3a460/interview-header.jpg" data-mid="84568710" border="0"  src="https://freight.cargo.site/w/1000/i/708d79a96d23ef5cbc65e253fe70c8824e278f3086f705947e852a801dc3a460/interview-header.jpg" /&#62;




	
	The phrase “all art is political” has been adopted - and refuted - by many. It’s a line that gets increasingly blurred by clients, budgets, briefs, timelines, invoices, and deliverables. One thing is clear, however: the creator, when non-white, is inherently political. The sheer act of working within a system designed for someone other than you carries a palpable tension; a strain that’s further intensified in times of social struggle.

Cue Albert Nguyen: an art director and graphic designer who, in quarantine, designed a benefit t-shirt in partnership with Montreal Thai restaurant, Pumpui, that raised funds for Sticky Rice’s Vietnamese pagoda fundraiser. Benefiting the Chùa Quan Âm pagoda, whose statues were vandalized during the first few weeks of the pandemic, Nguyen emblazoned the words “The Longest Sunday Ever” on the front: speaking to the current moment and its sluggish uncertainty. 

Born and raised in Montreal, with time spent living in Ottawa (where he first learned to speak English), Nguyen is someone unafraid of speaking his mind—to point out the gaping holes in our social fabric and ask: why? With this in mind, we invited him to answer a couple of our questions regarding his contribution to the fundraiser, the creative process, and everything in between.

	Q: When (or where) did you first realize that you were creative?

Creativity came to me at a very early age. I have been obsessed with drawing since I was very young. I thank my grandfather for that part of me, he was a great artist. I’d always ask him to draw for me. He-Man was the drawing I requested every time. I was obsessed with my grandfather and still am today. Art had always been in my life in one way or another even when I wasn’t drawing for a long period. Everything I loved had imagination and creativity to it like style and fashion. Creativity is something that surrounds every aspect of my life: to the way I love, to the way I cook, to the way I dress.



Q: How would you describe your design style?

It’s really hard to pinpoint my style, but if I had to I would have to say it’s a mish-mash. My style is really typography based and I like to mix typefaces a lot. I always like to have a little bit of humour in my work. It’s an amalgamation of all the things that have inspired me in my life - not just only art but also my life events and travels. It’s important to use all of that to make meaningful work and create an authentic narrative.

	Q: When and where do you feel the most creative?

Feeling creative can hit me absolutely anywhere. And the timeframe when I’m creative is large. I always like to leave a big window and space so I can work freely either at 9 am or 1 am. But I’m one of those creatives who can only work for short spurts and I need time to recharge. 


Q: What (or who) are your sources of inspiration, Asian, or otherwise? 

Inspiration for me comes from all over. I don’t believe that it only comes from design or our industries. Inspiration is something that comes with a full, well-rounded life. I get inspired by my travels, my friend’s travels, the food we cook, the conversations we have with our loved, and not-so-loved ones. It’s a combination of all those things. I truly believe there’s a take away in every situation, even if it seems banal or irrelevant to the work we’re doing. Inspiration is everywhere.
	

	“There were a lot of stories revolving around attacks on Asians due to COVID all over the world but there was a story that hit really close to home; Chùa Quan Âm. This broke my heart to hear that sort of thing could happen in our hometown, but there are ignorant people everywhere.”








	
	Q: When did the idea for a benefit t-shirt with Pumpui first come about? 

We were a few weeks into quarantine, Pumpui had already started their fundraiser for the COVID Relief Fund for Frontline Workers with Mathieu Dionne. So Jesse Massumi asked me to design a tee and pick a charity of my choice. At this point, there were a lot of stories revolving around attacks on Asians due to COVID all over the world but there was a story that hit really close to home; Chùa Quan Âm. This broke my heart to hear that sort of thing could happen in our hometown, but there are ignorant people 
everywhere.

	Q: What made you choose Sticky Rice’s Chùa Quan Âm fundraiser as your benefit of choice? 

After seeing Stick Rice Magazine have their own fundraisers, we decided to not only put the “Longest Sunday Ever” tee, we wanted to offer the entire Pumpui FW19 merchandise I designed for them before COVID because of its success during the first run. Giving the money to Sticky Rice was a no brainer for us. 

Q: In what ways have the last 5 months of this pandemic affected you or your work?

It’s needless to say that work has slowed down for many people in various industries, but what it taught me is to take things slow, to have a bit more purpose in my work. Thanks to Pumpui, I was able to help people with my designs and not just work solely for money. It taught me to help others as much as I can, voicing my opinions against injustices in the world, especially against Asians and BIPOC. Our voices have been silenced and dismissed for a long time.

	Q: Your ‘MY DUDES’ post during the recent wave of denunciations of sexual misconduct within Quebec has over 2,700 likes and 60 comments. Did you expect this kind of reaction?

To be honest, no. After a few days of reading these women’s stories, it made me think about all the women whom I love in my life who have been abused. I couldn’t sit there anymore without saying anything. It’s not normal to hear women tell stories of inappropriate speech, groping, abuse, and rape. The problem is clearly with us “dudes”, it’s a problem that we have to solve ourselves. I compare it a lot to racism, how it is not a minority problem but a problem that whites have to solve within their own communities. I thank every woman who has opened up to me to share their stories thereafter. I’m sorry for your pain, I hear and see you. We will try and do better. We have to.
	

	
“Quebec had a very long run in innovative design and direction, but lately, I’ve been wondering: where are the new voices?”







	
	Q: What changes do you think (or hope) are in store for creative industries, in Quebec and beyond, amid months of social and political upheaval?

The Quebec creative industry needs to change in a big way. It is extremely white. At times, I wonder where all the minorities are in the advertising agencies. Quebec had a very long run in innovative design and direction but lately, I’ve been wondering: where are the new voices? Are there no Black designers? No Asians who can give a different perspective that these companies or brands need? The same stories and narratives are being told and designed over and over. I think it’s because of the lack of diversity.


Q: On a lighter note: what would be your dream gig?

My dream gig would be either leading the direction for a brand I respect or growing my own business into something I can wake up to every day.

 
Q: What designers, Asian or otherwise, should we keep our eyes on?

My favourite creatives at the moment are Lian Benoit, Tam Vu, Richmond Lam, and the entire Asiancy. They are all so inspiring and it motivates me to push things further along not just in design but in every aspect of my life.

 
Q: What’s next for you, personally and professionally?

Honestly, I can’t tell you. Lately, I’ve been getting into a mindset of just letting my life move along without planning too much. Although there is one thing for sure, I will keep raising my voice for our Asian people and BIPOC communities. On another note, I want to help more kids in urban areas who grew up like me. Besides working, I want to have a bigger purpose in my life and help others where I can.

THE WISDOM OF STYLE: A MIX OF COLOURS, PRINTS AND ERAS&#38;nbsp;

A conversation with the creators of Chinatown Pretty
By Yang ShiSeptember 30th, 2020



	&#60;img width="3000" height="2000" width_o="3000" height_o="2000" data-src="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/63c7b13cc14f5f5c8708a28873c3e64e9b848254b53aa7a8a5e03129da2c5005/Header-image-min.jpg" data-mid="84032328" border="0"  src="https://freight.cargo.site/w/1000/i/63c7b13cc14f5f5c8708a28873c3e64e9b848254b53aa7a8a5e03129da2c5005/Header-image-min.jpg" /&#62;All images are courtesy of Chinatown Pretty.




	
	We learn a lot about a person by the clothes they choose to wear. The way they mix-and-match colours and patterns, layer fabrics, and carefully curate their ensemble to the last detail. Without a doubt, putting the perfect outfit together is an art. For the pòh pohs (grandmas) and gùng gungs (grandpas) of San Francisco's Chinatown, each garment contains decades of memories and reveals a lifetime of resourcefulness and creativity. Rooted in pragmatism, yet tinged with whimsy, the kaleidoscope of handmade and vintage pieces act as a testimony to their personal and shared immigrant stories—often marked by times of hardship and segregation. From a historical standpoint, the distinct fashion carries a collective symbol of resistance against the steadfast gentrification of surrounding neighbourhoods. 
Similar to these senior residents, Chinatown has become an adopted home to Valerie Luu and Andria Lo, the founders of Chinatown Pretty. Since 2015, the writer and photographer respectively have been roaming the streets of SF Chinatown documenting some of the most eclectic and vibrant street styles they have ever encountered. For Luu and Lo, who are Asian-American, this multigenerational project is an opportunity to learn and reconnect with their heritage and their own families. It also serves as a reminder to embrace the small joys of life in its most earnest expression. Five years later, Luu and Lo are finally ready to launch their first book chronicling the styles and pearls of wisdom of senior SF Chinatown citizens, and many other major cities across North America.

	01/ Where did the idea and name Chinatown Pretty originate from? Who was the first senior you’ve featured?Valerie: The idea came from our shared love for this distinct aesthetic. Andria and I would spend time in Chinatown, just hanging out, eating dim sum and we noticed the grandmas would wear colours and multiple layers. We were really curious where they got their clothes, how they were putting the outfits together in such an original way. We started just by writing an article about it - we went around interviewing seniors. The first person I noticed was a woman named Man Ta, who we ended up meeting and who’s on the cover of our book now! Whenever I was sitting at this cafe, I would see her get off of this bus. I would see her shoes first and she was wearing these 80’s speckled jade colour sneakers (Keds shoes). I would be so amazed, thinking this is an outfit you would see at Urban Outfitters but it’s worn by a woman in her late 70’s. And then, when Andria and I went out for the first time shooting for the articles, we met her and she gradually became our poster senior.



02/&#38;nbsp;What's the standard process for photographing and interviewing one of your subjects? You mentioned in a few posts that sometimes it takes several attempts to get someone’s permission. Are there any cultural barriers? And how has the pandemic affected your project recently?
Andria: So our standard process is, we stroll around Chinatown, maybe a few hours at a time, and we work with a translator who typically speaks Cantonese. We just walk around until a senior catches our eyes [laughing]. We will say hello and try to strike up a conversation, ask them about a specific piece. If they have time, we will ask them more about their backstory, if they are willing to chat more about their daily life and tell us more about their immigration story, and what they did before retirement. So, there are quite a few barriers, you probably saw that we have a pretty high rejection rate, maybe 9 out of 10 people turn us down to be ultimately photographed. We haven’t been able to shoot during the pandemic - we want to be sensitive to seniors who are a vulnerable demographic. People are staying indoors, and Chinatown is a little bit slower right now, so we haven’t been able to continue shooting.


03/ Having done this for a while now, have the people in the area started to recognize you? Or have you noticed some of the neighbourhood regulars actually dressing up in order to catch your attention?

V: I would say that we’ve done it for so many years now that we would start to recognize certain people. And some of the people we’ve photographed have become acquaintances or friends. Like the&#38;nbsp;Chews. I ran into Buck Chew on the streets and he would invite us for hot water and fruits at his apartment. And we used to see Man Ta around the neighbourhood grocery shopping. We would hold hands because we couldn’t speak each other’s language and we would only communicate through smiles. She showed a lot of gratitude and appreciation towards our brief, but significant interactions. And some people dress so cool and never have agreed to the project so we call them our unicorns, people we appreciate but haven’t been able to capture yet through a photo or a story.&#38;nbsp;

	04/ Do you go to Chinatown every day? What’s your routine like?V: I think during the height of the project we were going a few times a month, three hours at a time. I am actually in Chinatown right now, just 'cause I really miss it [laughing]. 


05/ What's the prime hour for senior watching?
V: The prime hour is 9 am to noon. So you catch people during their grocery shopping and exercise. 


06/ Chinatown Pretty is all about how to age gracefully while staying stylish. Do you notice any style trends among Chinatown seniors? What’s this season’s hottest trend? Who are the trendsetters and style icons?A: Definitely, some trends we notice in Chinatown are -- I don't think it’s seasonally based, it tends to be the “evergreen” style in Chinatown we first became enamoured with. We see a lot of pattern mixing, like plaid with floral, some bold colours with a calico print and all this in one outfit. There’s a lot of mixing of eras, maybe a coat they brought over with them from Hong Kong in the ’80s with a new cap they bought in Chinatown mixed with a hand-knit sweater from the ’50s. We love this kind of mix-and-match style; it's really quite powered by functionality and practicality. They retain a lot of their clothes over the decades and keep them in great condition. We also noticed a lot of reusing of the iconic Chinatown “Thank You” Bag as a purse or for grocery shopping. Definitely sun protection drives a lot of fashion. A lot of white brimmed hats to shield from the sun and maybe sometimes gloves. In terms of colours, there’s a lot of reds, pinks, and purples, which is a cultural trend. 

V: To add to that, we are all wearing masks now, so this is an accessory that’s often handmade. The seniors use a lot of cool fabrics. I saw a tropical-themed one the other day.

	07/ And a style you aspire to achieve in your elderly years?
A: 
The project definitely affected how I get dressed in the morning. I don’t have to think so hard about it anymore. I think that’s the beauty of how a lot of the seniors are getting dressed. Some do coordinate their outfits, but most of them are not dressing with the intention of people looking at them. It’s quite freeing actually.

	




	

“I think just hearing collectively from these stories of immigration and talking to many seniors, they really do reflect my family immigration story as well.”







	
	08/ Without a doubt, a lifetime of experience telling stories leads to incredible storytelling. From all the tales you’ve heard, what’s the most heartwarming one? 
V: There’s a woman named Run, Ms. Yang. She lives in an affordable housing building for seniors. She has this silver bob that she cut herself and an oversize blazer. We sat down in her apartment to interview her with her daughter, she told us she had Alzheimer and can’t remember her past too much. But she says that she's' healthy and her kids and grandkids are also healthy and good. I really liked her attitude, letting go of control and being happy with what she has.
A: 
Ms. Yang is a great story. I think just hearing collectively from these stories of immigration and talking to many seniors, they really do reflect my family immigration story as well. Like many other seniors, my grandmother worked as a seamstress in a factory when she came here. They couldn’t get a job anywhere else. That kind of resourcefulness really carried with their own personal story. It kinda hit home with me.&#38;nbsp;

	09/&#38;nbsp;What’s one piece of wisdom from your encounters that has made a significant impact on your personal outlook? 
V: Sometimes, the seniors would tell us “I feel so lucky to have met you” and I think what they bring are joy and serendipitous human encounters. It goes the same way for us. Every connection is so special, even if it’s for three minutes on the streets of Chinatown. It’s a reminder for me to appreciate seniors and people in general. And how much I miss that during the quarantine.&#38;nbsp;
	




	

“I feel very close to Chinese culture and very close to Chinatown through this project. It solidified my love for Chinatown, where I spend my time, where I feel at home, it’s a place I cherish and want to celebrate and protect.”









	
	10/&#38;nbsp;As second-generation Asian Americans, in what ways has Chinatown Pretty brought insight to your own cultural identity?
V: 
For me, it’s like what Andria was saying earlier, just connecting to family history and with my grandma generation, and even connecting with my grandma more. I interviewed my step-grandma from Hong Kong and my grandma from Vietnam. I am Vietnamese-American and my family immigrated over here. There are some shared experiences between Chinese and Vietnamese immigration. I feel very close to Chinese culture and very close to Chinatown through this project. It solidified my love for Chinatown, where I spend my time, where I feel at home, it’s a place I cherish and want to celebrate and protect. 
A: 
My mom was born in Boston Chinatown. My dad is from Hong Kong. This project kinda grounds how I think how they were raised. It answered a lot of my questions about their cultural upbringing. That’s one reason why this project started for me, this curiosity about Chinatown, as a neighbourhood with so much character and history.

	11/ 
What do you think Chinatowns around North America represent for the senior Asian community?

A: I think Chinatown has been historically this landing pad for immigrants and has become this community they can rely on. Not knowing the language or anyone and not having a lot of money. They can connect with folks from their region, like a support system for new arrivals. And it continues to be so, especially in San Francisco, where it’s very dense. A lot of seniors live here and a lot of services are available for them. 


12/ What are the differences across Chinatowns? In terms of style and stories in places like SF, LA, NYC, Chicago &#38;amp; Vancouver? Is there somewhere you would like to visit next?A: Yeah, I think SF has been our favourite, it’s where we started but it’s also such a vibrant Chinatown. We found that in Chicago, the Midwest and Vancouver, folks are really warm. We had a higher success rate for interviewing people. Maybe it’s because they are smaller cities. In the midwest in Canada, people are less jaded and more willing to open up to us. New York was tough, the styles tended to drift to darker clothing as you would think of a broader New Yorker city look, dark clothes, and sneakers. We also had a harder time talking to people over there.&#38;nbsp;


13/&#38;nbsp;Have you shown your project to your grandparents? What do they think of it?V: They both were interviewed for it and featured in our book. Because it’s really a love letter to them and all the grandmas and grandpas of Chinatown. One of my grandmas passed away during the making of this book and it felt really special to be able to use Andrea’s portrait of her. It really captured her beauty and essence. And that’s like how she will be remembered, at 86, modelling for us with all these outfits she brought from Hong Kong. When she was sick, I would read her all the different comments people have written on Instagram and I would say “Hey, 2000 people think you are beautiful too, it’s not just me” [laughing]. 

A: None of my grandparents are still with us so I haven’t been able to share this project with them. 



14/&#38;nbsp;What’s your earliest memory of your local Chinatown?V: I don’t really have one, because I didn’t grow up in the city. I was lucky enough to live here in my twenties and that’s really when I fell in love with the neighbourhood. It feels like you are somewhere else with its own architecture and population. There’s something visually and spiritually stimulating about this place.

A: I also didn’t grow up around Chinatowns, but my first impression was probably visiting San Francisco Chinatown when I was young and seeing the more touristy side of it. Once you live there, you realize it’s a real neighbourhood. 

V: I guess for a lot of people it’s the place where it reminds you the most of your family.&#38;nbsp;

  15/ 
Congratulations on your upcoming book! How did the idea of compiling all your work into print form first come about? What kind of exclusive content can we expect from it?A: 
There are so many stories that you won’t find on our Instagram or blog. There’s a total of 113 profiles that we did. A lot of the stories are longer and more in-depth. People we met up for different times and went to their apartment.



V: For me, there’s a big difference between how I read and consume information. A book allows me to sit on a couch and slowly observes the details. It’s just a different experience, especially during a time when I can’t see my grandparents as much. It makes me feel close to them and makes forward to the day when Andrea and I can approach seniors again [laughing].

Spotlight on
CHERYL SIM: CURATING A LIFE THROUGH ART

By Ivy Lerner-FrankPhoto by Yang Shi

September 24th, 2020

	&#60;img width="1536" height="2048" width_o="1536" height_o="2048" data-src="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/7e4048a6c7bba37cb3b335cab9a573a9b15cee4e0bee1cc21bf4e61830c6b7b7/header-image.jpg" data-mid="83486079" border="0"  src="https://freight.cargo.site/w/1000/i/7e4048a6c7bba37cb3b335cab9a573a9b15cee4e0bee1cc21bf4e61830c6b7b7/header-image.jpg" /&#62;



	

	Threads run through Cheryl Sim’s life: an Asian-Canadian woman of colour, the multi-media artist, musician, and filmmaker’s work and passions weave art, music, fashion design, and identity joyfully together. Sim is the accessible, informed, and dynamic face of the Montreal’s Phi Foundation for Contemporary Art, where she has been both the Foundation’s curator and managing director since 2016.
 
Sim was born in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1971, the same year that Trudeau père’s multicultural policy was launched and when immigration to Canada from non-European countries was opening up in earnest. Sim’s Chinese father and Filipina mother met in the US as students and were just the kind of immigrants the country was seeking to nation-build. Well-educated and English-speaking, the family truly represented a “model minority”. Even at a young age, Sim remembers being comfortable speaking to large groups and would be called upon to talk about her heritage, instrumentalized as a poster girl for multiculturalism. “Multiculturalism had its place in terms of nation-building, but what it actually means for uneven power relationships is another story,” she says.

	Sim came to be more critical of the policy as she got older, reflecting on whether or not assimilation can be truly complete. “You’re trying to negotiate the terrain, but all the while, simmering beneath, you still maintain connections to your cultural heritage that are private,” she notes. “As I evolved into adulthood, I came to see multiculturalism as more of a smokescreen.”

The threads of assimilation, belonging, and home have long preoccupied Sim. “I keep coming back to the term 'diaspora' as a term referring to ‘home’, but that’s not the reality for second-generation diasporans,” she says. Her most recent curation at the Phi Foundation Relations: Diaspora and Painting, weaves these themes together. Sim never lived in either China or the Philippines, the countries of her parents’ birth. Canada is home, and yet she, like others, is always questioned about her true origins; the eternal "where are you from?" Her first film, A Few Colorful Phrases, gives voice to these uncomfortable conversations in a wry, humorous way, belying its seriousness for her.

	Sim’s curatorial notes for the Relations show (on until November 29 in Montreal) talks about diaspora as a condition/experience in constant evolution, “providing agency and a sense of belonging for first-generation immigrants, and the generations that follow.” Being born at the same time as the multiculturalism policy has been a source of reflection and growth for Sim. “As a ‘model minority’, Canadian-born person of colour of Asian heritage, it seemed like a really great thing at the time. It’s a strategy of survival, though; you start to buy into these ideas, that Canada is a tolerant place.” 


Sim has been singing and playing piano since she was little, sang in the local St Lawrence Choir, and worked diligently to master jazz improvisation. “It’s impossible for me to not bring musical metaphors into my art and in the exhibitions that I get to curate,” she says. Her 2011 film Ode to the Cheongsam, an exploration of the charged history of this garment, ends with Sim singing an a cappella piece in Hokkien dialect about the grace of women wearing this “symbol of Chinese cultural identity and femininity”. Sim’s 2015 ephemeral multimedia show at Oboro Gallery, The Thomas Wang Project, was an homage to a great-uncle who met a tragic end in Republican China in 1948 and included her performing jazz in Mandarin, singing songs that Wang himself might have heard at the time. 

In 2017, as one of the artists featured in the In Search of Expo 67 project at the Musée d’art Contemporain, Sim wove the aspirational theme song Un jour, un jour into her piece. “Music is so important to any project, whether it’s nation-building or the promotion of a movie - it’s a powerful element.” Her use of music as metaphor is evident in her description of the Relations: Diaspora and Painting exhibit to visitors: “(this) multiplicity of voices with their joys, tensions, traumas, and struggles…allow for a polyphonic experience.”


Fashion and its cultural specificity is another thread that Sim draws on in her work. Probing the origins and experience of wearing the Chinese cheongsam dress in Ode to the Cheongsam, Sim incorporates audio interviews of Chinese-Canadian women both in love with and daunted by the cheongsam. There is no right or wrong here as she delves into the history of the garment, and we see her interacting with a young Hong Kong-trained tailor in Montreal as she explores her own relationship with the charged outfit. Her subsequent book, Wearing the Cheongsam, approaches the questions of heritage and assimilation more deeply and is one of the only scholarly books on the subject. 


Fifty years after Expo 67, where Sim’s parents honeymooned, Sim explored female identity through the lens of Expo hostesses and their uniform. For the MAC show In Search of Expo 67, Sim designed a fantasy mashup of the hostess skirt suit (which she describes as “sex appeal, with authority”) and what was then perceived as the quintessential outfit of the future — the pantsuit. Sim wears it in her multiscreen music video shot at the Expo site. &#60;img width="2048" height="1536" width_o="2048" height_o="1536" data-src="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/f3e45fdc5e37858771e285a6288346c6c182f58f9ec378496b910b4fef3e7749/image-6.jpg" data-mid="83486083" border="0" data-scale="98" src="https://freight.cargo.site/w/1000/i/f3e45fdc5e37858771e285a6288346c6c182f58f9ec378496b910b4fef3e7749/image-6.jpg" /&#62;Artwork from Relations: Diaspora and Painting.

	The one-zip pantsuit, by contrast to the skirt, is “an idealized garment - a democratic uniform that (would) neutralize gender, race, and class in the future.” Wearing a beanie identical to the one worn by hostesses during Expo, Sim sings the exposition’s official theme song Un jour, un jour, in the film, “a critical gesture designed to explore the slippages of the past, present, and future. Being a woman of colour, of Filipino and Chinese heritage, and born in Canada: there’s a lot of baggage wrapped up in that, in the package of the body,” she says. 

Tying these themes together, there’s a joyousness to Sim’s work; constantly revealing itself in her humour and her sheer warmth and approachability. The joy of singing, of creating, and of communicating easily with others is a value for Sim also reflected in the Phi Foundation’s principles: to be of service in a spirit of generosity, empathy, and inclusion. The joy comes through in the informative and engaging curatorial tours she will hopefully lead again at the Phi Foundation, when she explains the artist's perspective of the shows, and exhorts visitors to think about the origins and importance of art as part of daily life. In this, it’s also clear that Sim is deeply influenced by her long standing yoga practice and the sutras of Patanjali.

	“What I’ve learned in yoga says it all: may all beings be happy and free, and may my thoughts, words, and actions contribute to the happiness and freedom of all beings,” she says. “It’s in tune with how I’ve constructed my vision of how to live and do in the world, and endlessly helpful for doing my work. Operating from joy, keeping in mind the idea of being in service, we can just have a much more enjoyable ride through this life we’re leading.”
